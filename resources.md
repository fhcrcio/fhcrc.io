This page contains course descriptions for fredhutch.io classes. If you're interested in documentation about computing at Fred Hutch, or looking for additional tutorials or online lessons to learn programming, please see the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](http://sciwiki.fredhutch.org).

**Self-paced learning**: Each course below includes a link to the publicly available online training materials.
You are welcome to read through the teaching notes and other resources at your own pace.
Feel free to join weekly office hours or a community discussion group to ask questions;
please see the [calendar of events](https://fredhutch.github.io/coop/calendar/)
and the [Wiki page on training, office hours, and community groups](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/)
for more information.

**Instructor-led sessions** Most courses meet for 1-2 hours a class for 3-4 classes;
see the course listings below for more information.
If you are a Fred Hutch or SCCA employee, you can register for classes in
[Hutch Learning](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/training/access-hutch-learning.html) (internal link).
If the class you're interested in isn't currently available,
we recommend adding your name to the interest tracking system so you will receive a notification when the course is available again.
If the class in which you are interested in currently full,
add your name to the waitlist so we can add you if someone drops.

#### Data for Data Science

Researchers face a growing data management challenge, starting with data collection and continuing through data analysis, publication, and archival. Potential problems research labs may face include scalability of their data management methods to many and/or very large data files, fully documenting data and its organization, and meeting requirements of grants/publication related to data sharing. This four-Class course is designed to introduce attendees to best practices in data organization and management. Each one-hour lecture will include lecture, discussion, and practice exercises. This course assumes no prior training in data science. At the end of this course, you will be able to identify resources at Fred Hutch for data management and apply best practices in data organization to your own research projects. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/data_for_data_science).
* Class 1: Data entry and creating spreadsheets
* Class 2: Organizing data and project files
* Class 3: Documenting data with metadata
* Class 4: Data manipulation and reproducibility

#### Concepts in Machine Learning

This four class course is designed to introduce attendees to central concepts in machine learning as well as examples of applications in biomedical research. Each one hour lecture will emphasize conceptual and practical aspects of machine learning paradigms, explore the foundations of underlying mechanisms, and look at current or potential applications through examples or case studies. The course assumes a solid foundation in basic statistics, but does not assume any prior coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to understand the core differences between different forms of machine learning and consider their application with respect to a variety of problem spaces. This course (or equivalent knowledge/preparation) is intended as a prerequisite for future courses covering machine learning skills in both R and Python. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/concepts_machine_learning).
* Class 1: Introduction and Conceptual Overview; Machine Learning and Experimental Design
* Class 2: Supervised Learning via Regression
* Class 3: Supervised Learning via Classification
* Class 4: Unsupervised Learning via Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and Transfer Learning

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub

This two-class course (with optional third class) is designed to introduce attendees to git version control software and GitHub as a repository for code and/or data. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises. The first two sessions assume no prior programming knowledge. At the end of these two sessions, you will be able to use git to track changes to software and other files, and use GitHub to work collaboratively to publish repositories of code and/or data. The optional third session assumes attendees have a basic familiarity with using the command line to navigate through directories and work with files and will include an overview of the command line interface to access the full functionality of the git software. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/git_github_intro).
* Class 1: introduction to version control, git workflow with desktop clients (tracking changes, branching, merging, ignoring things)
* Class 2: Collaboration and code sharing with GitHub, resolving conflicts
* Class 3 (optional): git workflow on the command line

#### Introduction to R

This four-class course is designed to introduce attendees to R statistical programming and its broad applications. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees have no prior computer coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to use R to import, manipulate, and visualize data. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/R_intro).
* Class 1: R syntax, assigning objects, using functions
* Class 2: Data types and structures; slicing and subsetting data
* Class 3: Data manipulation with dplyr
* Class 4: Data visualization in ggplot2

#### Intermediate R: Machine Learning

This four class course introduces participants to implementation of machine learning methods in R using RStudio. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees are familiar with basic R syntax, using packages, and basic data manipulation using tidyverse. The course also assumes a strong foundation in basic statistics as well as prior/concurrent participation in the fredhutch.io course Concepts in Machine Learning (or equivalent experience). At the end of this course, you will be able to apply basic principles of machine learning to research questions and will have established a foundation for further exploration of machine learning techniques.
